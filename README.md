===========

I am simply github pages for projects and for users.  Cool stuff so far!

I followed the instructions to use to Automatic Page Generator for this paoject page.  It looks nice enough.  But it appears that I will have to use the github online editor in order to make any changes to content.  I really just want to work with simple Markdown text files.

Next up I'll try the manual method for creating a user page.
