I am playing with github pages for projects and for users.  Cool stuff so far!

I followed the instructions to use to Automatic Page Generator for this User page.  It looks nice enough.  But it appears that I will have to use the github online editor in order to make any changes to content.  I really just want to work with simple Markdown text files.

This is still a little complicated for me.  I'm finding this [page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages) helpful.

Next up I'll try the manual method for creating a Project page.
